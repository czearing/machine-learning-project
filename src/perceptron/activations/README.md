- Sigmoid functions and their combinations generally work better in the case of classifiers
- Sigmoids and tanh functions are sometimes avoided due to the vanishing gradient problem
- ReLU function is a general activation function and is used in most cases these days
- If we encounter a case of dead neurons in our networks the leaky ReLU function is the best choice
- Always keep in mind that ReLU function should only be used in the hidden layers
- As a rule of thumb, you can begin with using ReLU function and then move over to other activation functions in case ReLU doesn’t provide with optimum results
